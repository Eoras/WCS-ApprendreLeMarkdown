#Presentation

I've been passionate about code since I was young, I blossom in the code and deepen my knowledge day after day.

Following training at the Wild Code School, I got my software developer status. I am currently working at Apside where I'm developing my professional skills.

Dynamic, independent and detail-oriented are major assets of my personality.
